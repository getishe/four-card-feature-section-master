## Overview

This project is a responsive four-card feature section that showcases different features of a product or service. The design is clean and modern, with a focus on usability across various devices. The cards are arranged in a grid layout that adapts to the screen size, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this four card feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process

I started by analyzing the design provided in the challenge. I then set up a new Next.js project and created the necessary components for the cards. I used CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adjusts based on the screen size. The cards were styled using Styled Components to maintain a clean and modular code structure.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I also improved my skills in using Styled Components for styling React components, which allows for better modularity and maintainability of the code. Additionally, I gained experience in implementing hover effects and transitions to enhance user interaction with the cards.

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my CSS Grid skills and explore more advanced features such as grid areas and implicit grid tracks. I also want to learn more about responsive design techniques and how to optimize performance for mobile devices. Additionally, I aim to enhance my knowledge of Styled Components and explore theming capabilities for better design consistency across projects.
